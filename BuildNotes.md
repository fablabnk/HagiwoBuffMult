# V1.0

## Things to pay attention to whilst building
- cut down larger pin header sockets to single ones
- solder in jacks before pin sockets

## Design issues to fix in V1.1
- DONE: thicker traces 30 mil power 20 mil signal
- DONE: add 100nF caps
- DONE: optimise layout to minimise routing up and down the board
- DONE: widen 10uf cap footprint (hand soldering is tight)
- IGNORED: board edge clearance violation warnings
