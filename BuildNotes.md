# V1.0

## Things to note whilst building
- cut down larger pin header sockets to single ones
- solder in jacks before pin sockets

## Issues to fix in v1.1
- widen 10uf cap footprint (hand soldering is tight)
- what to do about board edge clearance violations (trace to board outline should be 0.3mm but is 0.12mm in many cases)
